# CSI FY Recruitment Form

## The official source code for the CSI FY Recruitment Form Website

---

### We had received numerous requests and compliments for this website, so we decided to reveal the source code and share how the website was created. So now we have the Source Code.

### We used the following technology stack: 
+ ### ReactJS
+ ### Material UI
+ ### Sheets2API.

### Most of you are probably familiar with ReactJS and Material UI, but Sheets2API assisted us in using Google Sheets as a database via Rest API. This greatly facilitated our development process, allowing us to complete more work in less time and solve all of our problems without integrating a backend, resulting in a completely frontend website.

### We welcome suggestions and queries, and the repository will accept contributions and value participation because learning shall be the primary outcome.
